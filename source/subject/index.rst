Power BI Project CIS 385
========================

My name is Jason Walburn. I will be documenting my Power BI project here for
CIS 385. During the project I plan on learning the basics of Power BI for
data analysis.

Introduction
------------
Power BI is according to Microsoft " A Business analytics solution that lets you
visualize your data and share insights across your organization. Connect
hundreds of data sources and bring your data to life with live dash boards and
report."  The first part of the project I plan on working though a course
from Udemy. Below is a quick outline the course path below.

* Section 1 : Introduction
* Section 2 : Intro Power BI
* Section 3 : Working in Query Editor
* Section 4 : Understanding the data model
* Section 5 : Creating Visuals
* Section 6 : Cloud with Power BI
* Section 7 : Other Data Sources
* Section 8 : Staying up to date Power BI.
